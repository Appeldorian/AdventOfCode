# AdventOfCode
My advent of code submission in Rust, as I am learning the language. Don't take my examples as optimal solutions, sometimes they get quite hacky and I'm mostly just wrestling with the language here, as well as trying to do things in some way that I'd like to know how to do, but isn't necessarily the best choice for the puzzle.
